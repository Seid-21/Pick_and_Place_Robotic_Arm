### Sample Arduino Code
```cpp
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo1, myservo2, myservo3, myservo4;
int bluetoothTx = 10;
int bluetoothRx = 11;

SoftwareSerial bluetooth(bluetoothTx, bluetoothRx);

void setup() {
    myservo1.attach(3);
    myservo2.attach(5);
    myservo3.attach(6);
    myservo4.attach(9);
    Serial.begin(9600);
    bluetooth.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    if (bluetooth.available() >= 2) {
        unsigned int servopos = bluetooth.read();
        unsigned int servopos1 = bluetooth.read();
        unsigned int realservo = (servopos1 * 256) + servopos;

        if (realservo >= 1000 && realservo < 1180) {
            int servo1 = map(realservo, 1000, 1180, 0, 180);
            myservo1.write(servo1);
        }
